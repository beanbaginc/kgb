version 1.1 final (5-December-2017):
	* Added returned(), last_returned(), raised(), last_raised(),
	  raised_with_message(), and last_raised_with_message() methods to
	  function spies.

	  See the README for how this works.

	* Added called_with(), returned(), raised(), and raised_with_message()
	  to the individual SpyCall objects.

	  These are accessed through spy.calls, and allow for more conveniently
	  checking the results of specific calls in tests.

	* called_with() and last_called_with() now accept matching subsets of
	  arguments.

	  Any number of leading positional arguments and any subset of keyword
	  arguments can be specified. Prior to 1.0, subsets of keyword arguments
	  were supported, but 1.0 temporarily made this more strict.

	  This is helpful when testing function calls containing many default
	  arguments or when the function takes *args and **kwargs.


version 1.0 final (31-October-2017):
	* Added support for Python 3, including keyword-only arguments.

	* Function signatures for spies now mimic that of the spied-on functions,
	  allowing Python's getargspec() to work.


version 0.5.3 final (28-November-2015):
	* Objects that evaluate to false (such as objects inheriting from dict)
	  can now be spied upon.


version 0.5.2 final (17-March-2015):
	* Expose the spy when using spy_on as a context manager.

	  Patch by Todd Wolfson.


version 0.5.1 final (2-June-2014):
	* Added support for spying on unbound member functions on classes.


version 0.5.0 final (23-May-2013):
	* First public release.
