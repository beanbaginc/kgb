version 3.0 final (23-March-2019):
	* Added an argument to spy_on() for specifying an explicit owner class
	  for unbound methods, and warn if missing.

	  Python 3.x doesn't have a real way of determining the owning class for
	  unbound methods, and attempting to spy on an unbound method can end up
	  causing a number of problems, potentially interfering with spies that
	  are a subclass or superclass of the spied object.

	  spy_on() now accepts an owner= parameter for unbound methods in order
	  to explicitly specify the class. It will warn if this is missing,
	  providing details on what it thinks the owner is and the recommended
	  changes to make to the call.

	* Fixed spying on unbound methods originally defined on the parent class
	  of a specified or determined owning class.

	* Fixed spying on old-syle classes (those not inheriting from object)
	  on Python 2.6 and early versions of 2.7.


version 2.0.3 final (18-August-2018):
	* Added a version classifier for Python 3.7.

	* Fixed a regression on Python 2.6.


version 2.0.2 final (9-July-2018):
	* Fixed spying on instances of classes with a custom __setattr__.

	* Fixed spying on classmethods defined in the parent of a class.


version 2.0.1 final (12-March-2018):
	* Fixed a regression in spying on classmethods.

	* Fixed copying function annotations and keyword-only defaults in Python 3.

	* Fixed problems executing some types of functions on Python 3.6.


version 2.0 final (5-February-2018):
	* Added compatibility with Python 3.6.

	* Spy methods for standard functions no longer need to be accessed like:

	      func.spy.last_call

	  Now you can call them the same way you could with methods:

	      func.last_call

	* The args and kwargs information recorded for a spy now correspond to
	  the function signature and not the way the function was called.

	* called_with() now allows providing keyword arguments to check positional
	  arguments by name.

	* When spying on a function fails for some reason, the error output is a
	  lot more helpful.


version 1.1 final (5-December-2017):
	* Added returned(), last_returned(), raised(), last_raised(),
	  raised_with_message(), and last_raised_with_message() methods to
	  function spies.

	  See the README for how this works.

	* Added called_with(), returned(), raised(), and raised_with_message()
	  to the individual SpyCall objects.

	  These are accessed through spy.calls, and allow for more conveniently
	  checking the results of specific calls in tests.

	* called_with() and last_called_with() now accept matching subsets of
	  arguments.

	  Any number of leading positional arguments and any subset of keyword
	  arguments can be specified. Prior to 1.0, subsets of keyword arguments
	  were supported, but 1.0 temporarily made this more strict.

	  This is helpful when testing function calls containing many default
	  arguments or when the function takes *args and **kwargs.


version 1.0 final (31-October-2017):
	* Added support for Python 3, including keyword-only arguments.

	* Function signatures for spies now mimic that of the spied-on functions,
	  allowing Python's getargspec() to work.


version 0.5.3 final (28-November-2015):
	* Objects that evaluate to false (such as objects inheriting from dict)
	  can now be spied upon.


version 0.5.2 final (17-March-2015):
	* Expose the spy when using spy_on as a context manager.

	  Patch by Todd Wolfson.


version 0.5.1 final (2-June-2014):
	* Added support for spying on unbound member functions on classes.


version 0.5.0 final (23-May-2013):
	* First public release.
