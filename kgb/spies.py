        # Prior to kgb 2.0, we attempted to optimistically replace

        # fake or original function. This was the design since kgb 1.0, but
        # wasn't sufficient. We realized in the first release that this
        # wouldn't work for standard functions, and so we had two designs:
        # One for methods, one for standard functions.
        #
        # In kgb 2.0, in an effort to standardize behavior, we moved fully
        # to the method originally used for standard functions (largely due
        # to the fact that in Python 3, unbound methods are just standard
        # functions).
        #
        # Standard functions can't be replaced. Unlike a bound function,
        # we can't reliably figure out what dictionary it lives in (it
        # could be a locals() inside another function), and even if we
        # replace that, we can't replace all the copies that have been
        # imported up to this point.
        #
        # The only option is to change what happens when we call the
        # function. That's easier said than done. We can't just replace
        # the __call__ method on it, like you could on a fake method for
        # a class.
        #
        # What we must do is replace the code backing it. This must be
        # done carefully. The "co_freevars" and "co_cellvars" fields must
        # remain the same between the old code and the new one. The
        # actual bytecode and most of the rest of the fields can be taken
        # from another function (the "forwarding_call" function defined
        # inline below).
        #
        # Unfortunately, we no longer have access to "self" (since we
        # replaced "co_freevars"). Instead, we store a global mapping
        # of codes to spies.
        #
        # We also must build the function dynamically, using exec().
        # The reason is that we want to accurately mimic the function
        # signature of the original function (in terms of specifying
        # the correct positional and keyword arguments). The way we format
        # arguments depends on the version of Python. We maintain
        # compatibility through the FunctionSig.format_arg_spec() methods
        # (which has implementations for both Python 2 and 3).
        #
        # We do use different values for the default keyword arguments,
        # which is actually okay. Within the function, these will all be
        # set to a special value (_UNSET_ARG), which is used later for
        # determining which keyword arguments were provided and which
        # were not. Anything attempting to inspect this function with
        # getargspec(), getfullargspec(), or inspect.Signature will get the
        # defaults from the original function, by way of the
        # original func.func_defaults attribute (on Python 2) or
        # __defaults__ (on Python 3).
        #
        # This forwarding function then needs to call the forwarded
        # function in exactly the same manner as it was called. That is,
        # if a keyword argument's value was passed in as a positional
        # argument, or a positional argument was specified as a keyword
        # argument in the call, then the forwarded function must be
        # called the same way, for argument tracking and signature
        # compatibility.
        #
        # In order to do this, we have to find out how forwarding_call was
        # called. This can be done by inspecting the bytecode of the
        # call in the parent frame and getting the number of positional
        # and keyword arguments used. From there, we can determine which
        # argument slots were specified and start looking for any keyword
        # arguments not set to _UNSET_ARG, passing them through to the
        # original function in the same order. Doing this requires
        # another exec() call in order to build out those arguments.
        #
        # Within the function, all imports and variables are prefixed to
        # avoid the possibility of collisions with arguments.
        #
        # Since we're only overriding the code, all other attributes (like
        # func_defaults, __doc__, etc.) will make use of those from
        # the original function.
        #
        # The result is that we've completely hijacked the original
        # function, making it call our own forwarding function instead.
